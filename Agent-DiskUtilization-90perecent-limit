Step 1: ssh into your server.

Step 2a: cd to the following directory to edit the "agent.app.config.yaml"

##Make sure your kasm docker container is stopped before editing the .yaml file###

##Note: In my instance, even though Kasm is installed under /mnt/cache/appdata/kasm > it is also located under /mnt/user/appdata/kasm
##Note: Personally, my appdata share is not set as cache only, I have mover autmatically move "cache > array" ;
##Note: Even with my containers storage set up correctly, I just don't want to chance any of my containers stopping because my cache pool is full.

Step 2b: cd /mnt/user/appdata/kasm/opt/kasm/1.14.0.1/conf/app

##Note: use your preferred cli editor, in my instance, its nano

Step 3: nano agent.app.config.yaml

##Edit the line #4 "disk_usage_limit: 0.9"

Example: "disk_usage_limit: 0.99".

Step 4: Save your edit/change, and exit out of the file.
- nano: CTL-X > Y > Enter

Now you can start your kasm docker again and should be able to continue pulling container images / install more Workspaces.

##Note: 90% Utilization in my instance: my disk free space on my Unraid server was currently at over 4TB Free, so increasing the threshold allowed more Kasm container images to be pulled and installed.
